# DeepLearning-Python
Deep Learning w/ TensorFlow

This code loads the MNIST dataset, which consists of images of handwritten digits, and preprocesses the data by scaling it to the range [0, 1]. It then defines a deep learning model with a flatten layer to convert the 2D image data into 1D vectors, a dense layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation, a dropout layer to prevent overfitting, and a dense layer with 10 neurons and softmax activation to produce probabilities for each of the 10 digit classes.

The model is then compiled with the Adam optimizer, sparse categorical cross-entropy loss, and accuracy metric. It is trained for 10 epochs on the training data and evaluated on the test data, achieving a test accuracy of around 0.98.

Finally, the model is used to make predictions on new data by calling the predict method on the first 10 test images, and printing the predicted digit classes.

This is just a sample code for building a deep learning model, and you may need to modify or extend it based on your specific problem or dataset. Additionally, you may need to experiment with different model architectures, hyperparameters, and optimization strategies to achieve better performance.
